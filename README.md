# DB-Implementation project part1
## 1. Brief description:
## Main intention was to generate data based on Wisconsin benchmark specification. The data is generated using script written in python language. Once the data gets generated, we load that into PostgreSQL database.

## 2. System working with and why chose it â€“
## PostgreSQL database, Python language. Reason for choosing this database is: we are familiar and have experience working with this database.  

## 3. Demonstrate that data is loaded into system:
## Uploaded CSV files are the ones that we extracted from the PostgreSQL select queries.   

## 4. Lessons learnt/ problems encountered:
## This project helped us to connect the bridge between a database system and python program. Learned to generate relations in pgadmin and populate them through a python file.
